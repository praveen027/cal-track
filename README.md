# Calorie Tracker
Calorie Tracker calculates the Body Mass Index of a user based on their weight, height, and age input. Based on the result we reccomend a daily calorie count. A user can also input calorie events that reduce or increase the daily calorie count based on the calorie event type. If you'd like to start keeping track of your daily calorie intake then Calorie Tracker is the application for you!
